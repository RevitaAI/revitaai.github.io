## Manage Groups



### How can I create a group?

The teacher can create groups for students:

* Go to the Home Page: Click _Groups_ ⇒  Click _Create New Group_ ⇒
* Add the name of the group, and a short description (optional).
    * You can enter a list of student emails into the same form.  You can attach additional teachers to the Group.
* Click _Create_
* After the group is created:
    * The Group Library will appear.  The teacher can **share** stories from the Private Library to the Group Library.
    * The teacher can follow the performance of the students by going to ⇒ Click _Analytics_.
    * The teacher can [add students to the Group](#how-can-i-add-students-to-a-group) or
      teachers and remove students or teachers from the group.

### How can I add students to a group?

* Go to the Home Page: ⇒  Click _Groups_ ⇒
* Select the group from your list of groups ⇒ click on its Title ⇒

There are two ways to add students:
1. If the teacher _knows the email addresses_ of the students:
    * Go to the Group ⇒ click on _People_ ⇒
    * Add student emails
    * Each student will receive an email, asking them to join:
        * If student was already registered, she gets invitation to join group in an email.<!--- (unless teacher is MASTER-OF-DOMAIN...) --->
        * If the student was not already registered in Revita, she becomes registered, and
          receives an email with her new username and password. (The student can change the password any time after logging in.)
1. If the teacher _does not know the email addresses_ of the students:
    * Go to the Group ⇒ click on _Show Key_
    * Copy and post the Group Key in a place where the students can pick it up — e.g., on the web site of a course.
    * Students can join the group using the key.  Each key is valid for 1 month.  New keys can be made any time.

### How can I use a Group Key to register students into a group?

Recommended **for schools / universities**: another way to add students to the Group is:
* go to the Management Tab in the Teacher's Groups view,
* click Show group key — the key is special code, a sequence of symbols.
* This key can be given to students — for example, by displaying it on the University's Couse page.
* Each student copies the key, and uses it to join the group at his or her convenience.

### How can I as a teacher get special rights to register students in my university into my groups?

**Recommended for schools / universities**:
Normal registration requires the student to accept the invitation to the group — which is sent to the student by email.
"Master of Domain" can register students directly, without email confirmation.
A "Master of domain" can add any student — who has an email address within the school's email domain — **without** invitation.  The teacher can register any student in the university directly into the teacher's group. 
A teacher can request the status of "Master of Domain" for her University's domain by contacting the Revita Team.

### Can I copy stories from my old course into a new course?

* Select _existing_ group(s) from which you want to inherit their libraries
* All stories (and flashcards) will be imported into the new group, and will apear as **hidden** from the students


____________________________________________________________________________


### Can I hide stories from the students for later use?

1. When sharing a story from Private Library: Click _Share hidden_
1. After a story has been shared: Go to Group Library ⇒ Select story ⇒ Click on its Title ⇒ Click _Hide story_
1. Later you can _Unhide story_

## Exercises based on stories

### How does Revita create exercises based on a story?

- Revita analyzes each story,
- It divides the story into **snippets** (2-3 sentences each),
- For each snippet, it creates exercises:
    - Words and phrases in the story are linked to grammatical topics that learners need to master.
    - The menu of topics can be seen by going to the Home Page ⇒ Click _Progress_ ⇒ Click _Grammar Progress_
    - Revita selects which grammatical topics are best suited for each learner's current level.
    - Learner's level is estimated based on all preceding answers to exercises: which topics the learner finds easy / difficult.
- Revita tries to select exercises that match the learner's level:
    - if exercises are often too easy — the learner would become bored,
    - if exercises are often too difficult — the learner would become frustrated,
- in either case — the learner will quit practicing.  Thus it is very important to find exactly the _right level of difficulty_.  Sometimes there may be an easy or a difficult exercise.
- Exercises are selected at random, so each time the student works with a story, the exercises will be different.


____________________________________________________________________________


### Can I decide exactly which exercises I want in a story?

Yes, you can create _Tailored Stories_:
* Choose a story from your Private Library ⇒ Click on its title ⇒ Click _Create Tailored Story_
* This allows you to specify — for any word or phrase in the story:
    * Which exercise _all_ students in the group will see,
    * What hints and feedback they receive.
This feature allows the teacher to have **full control** over what exercises all students will see.
However, this feature is not recommended for extensive use — it is more labor-intensive for the teacher.  It is easier to rely on Revita to offer appropriate exercises for **each** student — based on the student's previous performance: concepts which the student is not ready to learn will appear in exercises less frequently, as well as concepts that the student has already mastered.  The concepts that will appear more frequently are those that the student is most ready to learn next — based on the student's performance on recent exercises.
