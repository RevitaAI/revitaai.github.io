Leads the Language Learning Lab — studying how language works, and how computers can better understand language.  Research includes analysis of news media, and modeling language evolution. Current focus on AI support for language learning; Revita, currently in use by learners and teachers at several universities. Research focuses on support for smaller, endangered languages, as well as for "majority" languages. |
